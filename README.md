About this Repository
===================================
This repository is a work in progress.  Code here may be broken at any point in time.  This contains the source code for GnomeSequencer-Enahnced in its raw form.  Libraries are referred to but are not present in this repository.  While releases are tagged as releases, alpha builds are released via https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gse-gnome-sequencer-enhanced-advanced-macros  

To use this locally straight from this source you must install https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ace3 as a standalone mod.  You must also install all the libraries listed in the .pkgmeta in the lib folder and set an exclusion in your .git file.  If you are not familiar with Git and Curse's build management system don't download the releases from here and expect them to work.  Grab the full package from Curseforge.
